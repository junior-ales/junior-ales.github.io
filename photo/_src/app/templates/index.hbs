    I like to think of photography beyond techniques, colors, focus, depth and patterns.
    I'm fascinated about the story behind the lens. It's all about the unique way the
    person sees and feels the world around herself/himself in that given moment.
    <em>This blog is a way of telling my stories to everyone.</em>
