      <p>
      I like to think of photography more than techniques, colors, focus, depth and patterns. I'm fascinated about the photo story and the story of its photographer. It's all about the unique way the person sees and feels the world around herself/himself in that given moment. This blog is a way of telling my stories to everyone.
